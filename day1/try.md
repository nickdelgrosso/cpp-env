# Arrays and Strings in C++

## Introduction to Arrays

| Code                             | Description                           |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `int myArray[5];`                | Declares an array of 5 integers.      |
| `myArray[0] = 10;`               | Sets the first element to 10.         |
| `cout << myArray[0];`            | Prints the first element.             |
| `for(int i=0; i<5; i++) {}`      | A loop to traverse the array.         |
| `myArray[4] = myArray[0] + 2;`   | Sets the last element using first.    |

### Exercises
1. Declare an integer array of size 10 and initialize it with values 1 to 10.
```cpp
// Write your code here
```
2. Print all elements of the above array using a loop.
```cpp
// Write your code here
```
3. Set the fifth element of the array to zero.
```cpp
// Write your code here
```
4. Calculate the sum of all elements in the array.
```cpp
// Write your code here
```
5. Find the maximum element in the array.
```cpp
// Write your code here
```
6. Reverse the array elements.
```cpp
// Write your code here
```
7. Check if the array contains a given number (e.g., 5).
```cpp
// Write your code here
```
8. Increment each element of the array by 1.
```cpp
// Write your code here
```
9. Calculate the average of the array elements.
```cpp
// Write your code here
```
10. Create a function that takes an array as an argument and prints all its elements.
```cpp
// Write your code here
```

## Introduction to Strings

| Code                           | Description                           |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `char myString[10] = "Hello";` | Declares a string with 'Hello'.       |
| `cout << myString;`            | Prints the string.                    |
| `myString[4] = 'y';`           | Modifies the last character to 'y'.   |
| `strlen(myString);`            | Finds the length of the string.       |
| `strcpy(myString, "Hi");`      | Copies 'Hi' into the string.          |

### Exercises
1. Declare a string and initialize it with your name.
```cpp
// Write your code here
```
2. Print the length of the above string.
```cpp
// Write your code here
```
3. Change the first character of the string to 'A'.
```cpp
// Write your code here
```
4. Concatenate another string to your name string.
```cpp
// Write your code here
```
5. Check if a character (e.g., 'e') is present in the string.
```cpp
// Write your code here
```
6. Convert all characters in the string to uppercase.
```cpp
// Write your code here
```
7. Extract a substring from the string.
```cpp
// Write your code here
```
8. Reverse the string.
```cpp
// Write your code here
```
9. Replace all occurrences of a character (e.g., 'a') with another character (e.g., 'o').
```cpp
// Write your code here
```
10. Write a function that takes a string and an integer n and prints the first n characters of the string.
```cpp
// Write your code here
```
